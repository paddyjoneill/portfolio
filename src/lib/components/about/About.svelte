	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		Before I was a software developer I ran a small business and wanted a website to increase my customer base by 
		being easy to find and letting people know what I offered. I was overwhelmed by the various options and also 
		the high recurring costs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I want to help small businesses who where in the position I was and help them get a cheap to run, fast, SEO 
		friendly website with a professional email address. I spent far too much time trying to do this myself when I 
		could have been doing better things for my business and in the end I was also paying far more than I needed to
		for what I needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through my experience as a software developer I have tried and tested different technologies and ways to host them
		online and I can get your website hosted and email set up and the only recurring cost for you is to pay for your domain 
		(you can't get round this one).
